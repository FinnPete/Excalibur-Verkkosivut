            <h4>Ongoing Events</h4>
            <p>Every week on a Tuesday, there is a board game night in the clubroom from 5pm onwards, when there is always someone to play with. There is always a board member present at board game nights, making it easy to join.</p>
            <p>Every last Thursday of the month, a role-playing game night is held in the clubroom starting at 5 p.m. The club has plenty of rulebooks and other supplies for holding your own games.<br>
                One-shots, or one-session games, make it easy to get involved in any role-playing system.</p>
