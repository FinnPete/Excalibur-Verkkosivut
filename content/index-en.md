# Welcome to the Excalibur Website
Tampere academic roleplaying club Excalibur RY is a student club focusing on roleplaying-, card-, miniature- and boardgames. Our clubroom is located in room RD102, on the first floor of Rakennustalo, right next to the main entrance.

We have a weekly boardgame evening every tuesday starting at 17 at the clubroom.

If your are interested in playing or hosting a roleplaying campaign, you can message about it on the club's telegram channel (linked below). The clubroom has a lot of rulebooks from different games free to use for members.

In addition, Excalibur hosts many events throughout the year, including monthly roleplaying evenings and saunas. Information on these events will be posted in the Telegram chat, on this website, at the clubroom and on posters at campus.

There are usually several role-playing campaigns running on Excalibur. If you want to play or be a game leader in a role-playing campaign, you should follow the announcements and let us know if you are interested, for example by telegram.

You can find the links to the club's Telegram-channel, Discord-server, Wiki and social media accounts at the bottom right of this page.

On Wednesdays, the club gathers people interested in miniature games to play, paint and hang out. If you're interested in more miniatures gaming activities, you can find more information and gaming companionship here [Telegram group](https://t.me/+d-9d5X0o6E45NWZk) (The group is not officially part of Excalibur).
