### Location of the Clubroom
The clubroom is located in the lower lobby of the Rakennustalon (on the left side of the Main Building at the back of campus) just to the right of the main doors. The Clubhouse is always open when the Board is present or upon request.

When the clubroom is open, you are free to come in and play games.

### Ongoing Events
Every week on a Tuesday, there is a board game night in the clubroom from 5pm onwards, when there is always someone to play with. There is always a board member present at board game nights, making it easy to join.

Every last Thursday of the month, a role-playing game night is held in the clubroom starting at 5 p.m. The club has plenty of rulebooks and other supplies for holding your own games.

One-shots, or one-session games, make it easy to get involved in any role-playing system.

On Wednesdays, the club gathers people interested in miniature games to play, paint and hang out. If you're interested in more miniatures gaming activities, you can find more information and people to play with from this [Telegram Group](https://t.me/+d-9d5X0o6E45NWZk) (The group is not officially part of Excalibur)

The Hervanna Academic Chess Club of Matti cooperates with the club. Link to the club's website [here](https://hervannan-matti.webnode.fi/).
